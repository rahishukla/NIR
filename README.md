# NIR
Name Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in a text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. named entity recognition NLP is also used to extract structured information from unstructured text and is a key task in many NLP applications, such as question answering, information retrieval, and machine translation.

Introduction
In today's world, we are constantly generating vast amounts of text data through social media, news articles, emails, and more. While this data contains valuable information, it is often unstructured and easier to analyze with proper processing. Named entity recognition NLP is one tool that can help extract useful information from unstructured text data by identifying and classifying named entities.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on extracting and classifying named entities in text. Named entities are specific terms that represent real-world objects, such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. The named entity recognition NLP model aims to identify and classify these named entities to extract useful information from unstructured text data.

What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?
As mentioned above, the named entity recognition NLP model identifies and classifies named entities in text. Named entities are specific terms that represent real-world objects, such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. NER aims to extract these named entities from text and classify them into predefined categories.
For example, consider the following sentence: "Barack Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961."

In this sentence, "Barack Obama" is a person, "Hawaii" is a location, and "August 4, 1961" is a date. We can extract valuable information about Barack Obama's birthplace and birthdate by identifying and classifying these named entities.

Different Blocks Present in A Typical NER Model
A typically named entity recognition NLP model consists of several components, including:

Tokenization: Tokenization breaks text into individual tokens (usually words or punctuation marks).
Part-of-speech tagging: Labelling each token with its corresponding part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
Chunking: Group tokens into "chunks" based on their part-of-speech tags.
Name entity recognition: Identifying named entities and classifying them into predefined categories.
Entity disambiguation: The process of determining the correct meaning of a named entity, especially when multiple entities with the same name are present in the text.
